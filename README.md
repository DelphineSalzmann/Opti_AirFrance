## Overview of the data

For all the dates entered, we have datasets that contain the following data structure:

\begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
    \caption{Data Structure}
    \label{tab234}
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
        \textbf{Column} & \textbf{Description} \\
        Num√©ro du groupe  & Group number associated with passengers \\
        Femmes & Number of women in the group
 \\
        Hommes & Number of men in the group \\
        WCHR & Number of passengers using wheelchairs in the group\\
        TransitTime  & Transit time for each passenger in the group \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

## Static model

We can see that the problem of allocating passengers on an airplane requires a binary variable $S_{ij}$, which associates each passenger $i$ with a seat $j$:

\begin{equation} 
    S_{ij} = 
    \begin{cases} 
    1 & \text{if Passenger i is in seat j}\\ 
    0 &\text{otherwise} 
    \end{cases} 
\end{equation}

To meet the restriction of having a maximum of one passenger per seat:

\begin{equation} 
\sum_{i=1}^{n_p} S_{ij} \leq 1 ~~\forall j \in [1, n_s]
\end{equation}

where $n_p$ is the number of passengers and $n_s$ the number of seats.

To meet the restriction that every passenger has one and only one seat:

\begin{equation} 
\sum_{j=1}^{n_s} S_{ij} = 1 ~~\forall i \in [1, n_p]
\end{equation}
